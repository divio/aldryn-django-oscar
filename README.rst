Aldryn Django Oscar
===================

Aldryn Django Oscar is a simple wrapper around django-oscar to easily install the package on Aldryn Cloud.

Oscar is an e-commerce framework for Django designed for building domain-driven sites. It is structured such that any part of the core functionality can be customised to suit the needs of your project. This allows a wide range of e-commerce requirements to be handled, from large-scale B2C sites to complex B2B sites rich in domain-specific business logic.

Key settings
